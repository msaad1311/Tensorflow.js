         <h1>Hands-On Machine Learning with TensorFlow.js</h1>
         <h3 style="color: #FA8D11"> A quick and easy way for JavaScript developers to begin their journey with machine learning</h3>
         <p>	Machine learning is a growing and in-demand skill, but so far JavaScript developers have not been able to take advantage of it due to the steep learning curve involved in learning a new language. TensorFlow.js is a great way to begin learning machine learning in the browser with TensorFlow.js. It allows you to operate offline to train new models and retrain existing models.
		 <br><br>
		 This course covers most of the major topics in machine learning and explains them with the help of TensorFlow.js implementations. The course is focused on the result-oriented nature of most JavaScript developers, and focuses on TensorFlow.js to the fullest in the least amount of time.
		 <br><br>
		 At the end of the course, you’ll evaluate and implement the right model to design smarter applications. 
		 <br><br>
